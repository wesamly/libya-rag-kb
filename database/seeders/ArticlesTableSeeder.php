<p>Libya is an oil-rich country located in North Africa; it is bordered by the Mediterranean Sea to the north and shares borders with Egypt to the east, Tunisia and Algeria to the west, and Niger, Chad, and Sudan to the south. The country is known for its culture and history and contains some of the world’s most well-preserved ruins from ancient civilizations.</p>
<p>The history of Libya comprises six distinct periods: Ancient Libya, the Roman Era, the Islamic Era, Ottoman Rule, Italian Rule, and the Modern Era.</p>
<p>The Phoenicians were the first to establish trading posts in Libya where Phoenicians from Tyre, Lebanon established commercial relations and treaties with Libya\'s early inhabitants. In 630 BCE, the ancient Greeks colonized eastern Libya and founded the city of Cyrene. Within 200 years, four more important Greek cities were established, and Cyrene became one of the greatest intellectual and artistic centers of ancient Libya. It was also famous for its medical and philosophical schools and architecture.</p>
<p>The Romans ruled over what is now Libya from 146 BCE to the seventh century CE, starting with the fall of Carthage and lasting until the Muslim Arabs conquered it. Tripolitania and Cyrenaica were part of a cosmopolitan state whereby its citizens shared a common language, legal system, and Roman identity. Roman ruins like Leptis Magna and Sabratha attest to the vitality and greatness of this region.<br>
</p>
<p>Islamic rule started as early as 642 CE when armies under the command of Amr ibn al-A\'as conquered what was then Cyrenaica. During the Islamic civilization, the predominant religion in Libya became the Islamic faith and the official language became Arabic. The Berber languages are also spoken in various parts of the country. The Muslim empire, with its rich contributions to human civilization in the arts and sciences, added another rich dimension to Libya’s identity.<br>
<br>
During the 16th century, Libya became part of the Ottoman Empire until the Italian occupation of the country in 1911. Under Italian rule, the new colonizers were met with significant opposition, namely in the form of the Senussi Order, which was eventually led by Idris as-Senussi.<br>
<br>
Following the end of World War II, the former Italian colony was administered jointly by France and Great Britain. In 1951, Libya declared its independence on December 24th, establishing the Libyan monarchy under King Idris, who reigned from 1951 to 1969.<br>
<br>
With King Idris’ government growing increasingly unpopular towards the end of the 1960s, corruption and entrenched systems of patronage became widespread across the recently centralized oil industry, which is Libya’s economic lifeline. At the same time, Arab nationalism was growing in popularity, and with Idris’ pro-Western tendencies, anti-Western riots broke out in the cities of Tripoli and Benghazi. On 1 September 1969, Muammar Qaddafi’s Free Officers took control of the country’s airports, police depots, radio stations, and government officers. Once Qaddafi had removed the monarchical government in this coup d’etat, the Libyan Arab Republic was born, ushering in a new era for Libyan politics.<br>
<br>
In 2011, the Libyan people rose up and created the Libyan Revolution. Taking place from 15 February 2011 to 23 October 2011. Also known as the “17 February Revolution,” this revolt sparked a civil war in the country, ultimately leading to the fall of the previous regime on 20 October 2011. The National Transitional Council (NTC), which was established on 16 September 2011 as a replacement, and declared 23 October as the official end of the war. This date is celebrated every year as a national holiday by Libyans across the country. Today, modern Libya is an emerging North African democracy that continues to develop its national consciousness, identity, and institutions.<br>

<p>Libya joined OPEC in 1962 and, apart from petroleum, Libya’s other natural resources are natural gas and gypsum. The sale of crude oil has given Libya one of the highest nominal per capita GDPs in Africa. The Libyan economy depends primarily on the oil sector, which represents about 69 percent of export earnings. Oil reserves in Libya are the largest in Africa and among the ten largest globally, with an estimated 46.4 billion barrels. Moreover, the oil and gas sector accounts for about 60 percent of Libya\'s total GDP. However, Libya’s sales of oil and natural gas collapsed during the 2011 revolution, rebounded in 2012 and 2013, and fell again in late 2013 and throughout 2014 due to unrest at Libyan oil ports. Oil production jumped again toward the end of 2019 to reach its normal level of 1.3 million barrels per day.</p>
<p>Despite the lengthy conflict in Libya with its heavy toll on the Libyan economy and the wellbeing of the population, many experts still believe that once conditions improve, Libya has an immense potential to develop its untapped resources and to become once again a prosperous country.</p>
<p>At the beginning of 2019, the World Bank Group announced a new strategy of support for Libya, which focused on restoring key services to Libyan citizens and promoting economic recovery as a critical contribution to the ongoing peace process.<br>
</p>
<p>One of the main goals of the World Bank strategy is to accelerate economic recovery by helping build the capacity of the government to manage public funds, while developing the private and financial sectors. The second part of this strategy aims to promote transparency, accountability and inclusion in the government decision-making and service delivery.<br>

<p>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Transitional_Council" title="National Transitional Council">National Transitional Council</a>, established in 2011, referred to the state as simply "Libya".

In November 2011, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_3166-1" title="ISO 3166-1">ISO 3166-1</a> was altered to reflect the new country name "Libya" in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/English_language" title="English language">English</a>, <i>"Libye (la)"</i> in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_language" title="French language">French</a>.<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Libya#cite_note-34">[31]</a>

<p>In December 2017, the Permanent Mission of Libya to the United Nations informed the UN that the country\'s official name was henceforth the "State of Libya"; "Libya" remained the official short form, and the country continued to be listed under "L" in alphabetical lists.<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Libya#cite_note-35">[32]</a>

<p>The coastal plain of Libya was inhabited by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neolithic" title="Neolithic">Neolithic</a> peoples from as early as 8000 BC. The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Afroasiatic_languages" title="Afroasiatic languages">Afroasiatic</a> ancestors of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berber_people" title="Berber people">Berber people</a> are assumed to have spread into the area by the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Late_Bronze_Age" title="Late Bronze Age">Late Bronze Age</a>. The earliest known name of such a tribe was the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Garamantes" title="Garamantes">Garamantes</a>, based in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germa" title="Germa">Germa</a>. The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phoenicia" title="Phoenicia">Phoenicians</a> were the first to establish trading posts in Libya.<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Libya#cite_note-36">[33]</a> By the 5th century BC, the greatest of the Phoenician colonies, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carthage" title="Carthage">Carthage</a>, had extended its <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hegemony" title="Hegemony">hegemony</a> across much of North Africa, where a distinctive civilisation, known as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Punic" title="Punic">Punic</a>, came into being.
</p>

<p>In 630 BC, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ancient_Greece" title="Ancient Greece">ancient Greeks</a> colonised the area around <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barca_(ancient_city)" title="Barca (ancient city)">Barca</a> in Eastern Libya and founded the city of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyrene,_Libya" title="Cyrene, Libya">Cyrene</a>.<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Libya#cite_note-37">[34]</a> Within 200 years, four more important Greek cities were established in the area that became known as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyrenaica" title="Cyrenaica">Cyrenaica</a>.<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Libya#cite_note-38">[35]</a> The area was home to the renowned philosophy school of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyrenaics" title="Cyrenaics">Cyrenaics</a>. In 525 BC the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persian_people" title="Persian people">Persian</a> army of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cambyses_II" title="Cambyses II">Cambyses II</a> overran Cyrenaica, which for the next two centuries remained under Persian or Egyptian rule. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexander_the_Great" title="Alexander the Great">Alexander the Great</a> ended Persian rule in 331 BC and received tribute from Cyrenaica. Eastern Libya again fell under the control of the Greeks, this time as part of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ptolemaic_Kingdom" title="Ptolemaic Kingdom">Ptolemaic Kingdom</a>.
</p>

<p>After the fall of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carthage" title="Carthage">Carthage</a> the Romans did not immediately occupy <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tripolitania" title="Tripolitania">Tripolitania</a> (the region around Tripoli), but left it instead under control of the kings of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Numidia" title="Numidia">Numidia</a>, until the coastal cities asked and obtained its protection.<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Libya#cite_note-be202-39">[36]</a> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ptolemy_Apion" title="Ptolemy Apion">Ptolemy Apion</a>, the last Greek ruler, bequeathed Cyrenaica to Rome, which formally annexed the region in 74 BC and joined it to Crete as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creta_et_Cyrenaica" title="Creta et Cyrenaica">a Roman province</a>. As part of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Africa_Nova" title="Africa Nova">Africa Nova</a> province, Tripolitania was prosperous,<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Libya#cite_note-be202-39">[36]</a> and reached a golden age in the 2nd and 3rd centuries, when the city of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leptis_Magna" title="Leptis Magna">Leptis Magna</a>, home to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Severan_dynasty" title="Severan dynasty">Severan dynasty</a>, was at its height.<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Libya#cite_note-be202-39">[36]</a>
</p>

<p>On the eastern side, Cyrenaica\'s first Christian communities were established by the time of the Emperor <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Claudius" title="Claudius">Claudius</a>.<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Libya#cite_note-be417-40">[37]</a> It was heavily devastated during the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kitos_War" title="Kitos War">Kitos War</a><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Libya#cite_note-ro364-41">[38]</a> and almost depopulated of Greeks and Jews alike.<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Libya#cite_note-42">[39]</a> Although repopulated by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trajan" title="Trajan">Trajan</a> with military colonies,<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Libya#cite_note-ro364-41">[38]</a> from then started its decline.<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Libya#cite_note-be417-40">[37]</a> Libya was early to convert to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicene_Christianity" title="Nicene Christianity">Nicene Christianity</a> and was the home of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pope_Victor_I" title="Pope Victor I">Pope Victor I</a>; however, Libya was also home to many non-Nicene varieties of early Christianity, such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arianism" title="Arianism">Arianism</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donatism" title="Donatism">Donatism</a>.

Main article: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islamic_Tripolitania_and_Cyrenaica" title="Islamic Tripolitania and Cyrenaica">Islamic Tripolitania and Cyrenaica</a></p>

<p>Under the command of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amr_ibn_al-As" title="Amr ibn al-As">Amr ibn al-As</a>, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rashidun_army" title="Rashidun army">Rashidun army</a> conquered <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyrenaica" title="Cyrenaica">Cyrenaica</a>.<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Libya#cite_note-be278-43">[40]</a> In 647 an army led by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abdullah_ibn_Saad" title="Abdullah ibn Saad">Abdullah ibn Saad</a> took Tripoli from the Byzantines definitively.<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Libya#cite_note-be278-43">[40]</a> The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fezzan" title="Fezzan">Fezzan</a> was conquered by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uqba_ibn_Nafi" title="Uqba ibn Nafi">Uqba ibn Nafi</a> in 663. The Berber tribes of the hinterland accepted Islam, however they resisted Arab political rule.<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Libya#cite_note-44">[41]</a> For the next several decades, Libya was under the purview of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Umayyad_Caliphate" title="Umayyad Caliphate">Umayyad</a> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caliph_of_Damascus" title="Caliph of Damascus">Caliph of Damascus</a> until the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abbasid_Caliphate" title="Abbasid Caliphate">Abbasids</a> overthrew the Umayyads in 750, and Libya came under the rule of Baghdad. When Caliph <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harun_al-Rashid" title="Harun al-Rashid">Harun al-Rashid</a> appointed <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ibrahim_I_ibn_al-Aghlab" title="Ibrahim I ibn al-Aghlab">Ibrahim ibn al-Aghlab</a> as his governor of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ifriqiya" title="Ifriqiya">Ifriqiya</a> in 800, Libya enjoyed considerable local autonomy under the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aghlabid" title="Aghlabid">Aghlabid</a> dynasty. By the 10th century, the Shiite <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fatimids" title="Fatimids">Fatimids</a> controlled Western Libya, and ruled the entire region in 972 and appointed <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bologhine_ibn_Ziri" title="Bologhine ibn Ziri">Bologhine ibn Ziri</a> as governor.<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Libya#cite_note-be202-39">[36]</a>
</p>

<p>Ibn Ziri\'s Berber <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zirid_dynasty" title="Zirid dynasty">Zirid dynasty</a> ultimately broke away from the Shiite Fatimids, and recognised the Sunni Abbasids of Baghdad as rightful Caliphs. In retaliation, the Fatimids brought about the migration of thousands from mainly two Arab Qaisi tribes, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Banu_Sulaym" title="Banu Sulaym">Banu Sulaym</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Banu_Hilal" title="Banu Hilal">Banu Hilal</a> to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Africa" title="North Africa">North Africa</a>. This act drastically altered the fabric of the Libyan countryside, and cemented the cultural and linguistic Arabisation of the region.<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Libya#cite_note-be202-39">[36]</a>
</p>

<p>Zirid rule in Tripolitania was short-lived though, and already in 1001 the Berbers of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Banu_Khazrun" title="Banu Khazrun">Banu Khazrun</a> broke away. Tripolitania remained under their control until 1146, when the region was overtaken by the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normans_of_Sicily" title="Normans of Sicily">Normans of Sicily</a>.<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Libya#cite_note-be203-45">[42]</a> For the next 50 years, Tripolitania was the scene of numerous battles among <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ayyubid_dynasty" title="Ayyubid dynasty">Ayyubids</a>, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Almohad_Caliphate" title="Almohad Caliphate">Almohad</a> rulers and insurgents of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Banu_Ghaniya" title="Banu Ghaniya">Banu Ghaniya</a>. Later, a general of the Almohads, Muhammad ibn Abu Hafs, ruled Libya from 1207 to 1221 before the later establishment of the Tunisian <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hafsid_dynasty" title="Hafsid dynasty">Hafsid Kingdom</a><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Libya#cite_note-be203-45">[42]</a> independent from the Almohads. In the 14th century, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Banu_Thabit" title="Banu Thabit">Banu Thabit</a> dynasty ruled Tripolitania before reverting to direct Hafsid control. By the 16th century, the Hafsids became increasingly caught up in the power struggle between Spain and the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ottoman_Empire" title="Ottoman Empire">Ottoman Empire</a>.
</p>

<p>After Abbasid control was weakened, Cyrenaica was under Egypt-based states such as the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tulunids" title="Tulunids">Tulunids</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ikhshidid_dynasty" title="Ikhshidid dynasty">Ikhshidids</a>, Ayyubids, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mamluk_Sultanate" title="Mamluk Sultanate">Mamluks</a> before Ottoman conquest in 1517. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fezzan" title="Fezzan">Fezzan</a> acquired independence under Awlad Muhammad dynasty after <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kanem%E2%80%93Bornu_Empire" title="Kanem–Bornu Empire">Kanem</a> rule. Ottomans finally conquered Fezzan between 1556 and 1577.

Main article: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ottoman_Tripolitania" title="Ottoman Tripolitania">Ottoman Tripolitania</a></p>

<p>After a successful invasion of Tripoli by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Habsburg_Spain" title="Habsburg Spain">Habsburg Spain</a> in 1510,<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Libya#cite_note-be203-45">[42]</a> and its handover to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knights_Hospitaller" title="Knights Hospitaller">Knights Hospitaller</a>, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ottoman_Empire" title="Ottoman Empire">Ottoman</a> admiral <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sinan_Pasha_(Ottoman_admiral)" title="Sinan Pasha (Ottoman admiral)">Sinan Pasha</a> took control of Libya in 1551.<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Libya#cite_note-be203-45">[42]</a> His successor <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turgut_Reis" title="Turgut Reis">Turgut Reis</a> was named the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bey" title="Bey">Bey</a> of Tripoli and later <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pasha_of_Tripoli" title="Pasha of Tripoli">Pasha of Tripoli</a> in 1556. By 1565, administrative authority as regent in Tripoli was vested in a <i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pasha" title="Pasha">pasha</a></i> appointed directly by the <i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sultan" title="Sultan">sultan</a></i> in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constantinople" title="Constantinople">Constantinople</a>/<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Istanbul" title="Istanbul">Istanbul</a>. In the 1580s, the rulers of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fezzan" title="Fezzan">Fezzan</a> gave their allegiance to the sultan, and although Ottoman authority was absent in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyrenaica" title="Cyrenaica">Cyrenaica</a>, a <i>bey</i> was stationed in Benghazi late in the next century to act as agent of the government in Tripoli.<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Libya#cite_note-be417-40">[37]</a> European <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barbary_slave_trade" title="Barbary slave trade">slaves</a> and large numbers of enslaved Blacks transported from Sudan were also a feature of everyday life in Tripoli. In 1551, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turgut_Reis" title="Turgut Reis">Turgut Reis</a> enslaved almost the entire population of the Maltese island of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gozo" title="Gozo">Gozo</a>, some 5,000 people, sending them to Libya.<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Libya#cite_note-46">[43]</a><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Libya#cite_note-47">[44]</a>
</p>

<p>In time, real power came to rest with the pasha\'s corps of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Janissaries" title="Janissaries">janissaries</a>.<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Libya#cite_note-be203-45">[42]</a> In 1611 the <i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dey" title="Dey">deys</a></i> staged a coup against the pasha, and Dey Sulayman Safar was appointed as head of government. For the next hundred years, a series of <i>deys</i> effectively ruled Tripolitania. The two most important Deys were <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mehmed_Saqizli" title="Mehmed Saqizli">Mehmed Saqizli</a> (r. 1631–49) and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Osman_Saqizli" title="Osman Saqizli">Osman Saqizli</a> (r. 1649–72), both also Pasha, who ruled effectively the region.<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Libya#cite_note-be204-48">[45]</a> The latter conquered also Cyrenaica.<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Libya#cite_note-be204-48">[45]</a>
</p>

<p>Lacking direction from the Ottoman government, Tripoli lapsed into a period of military anarchy during which coup followed coup and few deys survived in office more than a year. One such coup was led by Turkish officer <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ahmed_Karamanli" title="Ahmed Karamanli">Ahmed Karamanli</a>.<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Libya#cite_note-be204-48">[45]</a> The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karamanli_dynasty" title="Karamanli dynasty">Karamanlis</a> ruled from 1711 until 1835 mainly in Tripolitania, and had influence in Cyrenaica and Fezzan as well by the mid-18th century. Ahmed\'s successors proved to be less capable than himself, however, the region\'s delicate balance of power allowed the Karamanli. The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1793%E2%80%9395_Tripolitanian_civil_war" title="1793–95 Tripolitanian civil war">1793–95 Tripolitanian civil war</a> occurred in those years. In 1793, Turkish officer <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trabluslu_Ali_Pasha" title="Trabluslu Ali Pasha">Ali Pasha</a> deposed Hamet Karamanli and briefly restored Tripolitania to Ottoman rule. Hamet\'s brother <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yusuf_Karamanli" title="Yusuf Karamanli">Yusuf</a> (r. 1795–1832) re-established Tripolitania\'s independence. In 1816, Yusuf ordered the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Al-Jawazi_massacre" title="Al-Jawazi massacre">massacre of the al-Jawazi tribe</a>.<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Libya#cite_note-49">[46]</a> 
</p>

<p>In the early 19th century war broke out between the United States and Tripolitania, and a series of battles ensued in what came to be known as the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_Barbary_War" title="First Barbary War">First Barbary War</a> and the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_Barbary_War" title="Second Barbary War">Second Barbary War</a>. By 1819, the various treaties of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Napoleonic_Wars" title="Napoleonic Wars">Napoleonic Wars</a> had forced the Barbary states to give up piracy almost entirely, and Tripolitania\'s economy began to crumble. As Yusuf weakened, factions sprung up around his three sons. Civil war soon resulted.<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Libya#cite_note-be205-50">[47]</a>
</p>

<p>Ottoman Sultan <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mahmud_II" title="Mahmud II">Mahmud II</a> sent in troops ostensibly to restore order, marking the end of both the Karamanli dynasty and an independent Tripolitania.<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Libya#cite_note-be205-50">[47]</a> Order was not recovered easily, and the revolt of the Libyan under Abd-El-Gelil and Gûma ben Khalifa lasted until the death of the latter in 1858.<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Libya#cite_note-be205-50">[47]</a> The second period of direct Ottoman rule saw administrative changes, and greater order in the governance of the three provinces of Libya. Ottoman rule finally reasserted to Fezzan between 1850 and 1875 for earning income from Saharan commerce.

Some 150,000 Italians settled in Libya, constituting roughly 20% of the total population.<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Libya#cite_note-52">[49]</a>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Omar_Mukhtar" title="Omar Mukhtar">Omar Mukhtar</a> rose to prominence as a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Libyan_resistance_movement" title="Libyan resistance movement">resistance leader</a> against Italian colonisation and became a national hero despite his capture and execution on 16 September 1931.<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Libya#cite_note-53">[50]</a> His face is currently printed on the Libyan ten dinar note in memory and recognition of his patriotism. Another prominent resistance leader, Idris al-Mahdi as-Senussi (later <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Idris_of_Libya" title="Idris of Libya">King Idris I</a>), Emir of Cyrenaica, continued to lead the Libyan resistance until the outbreak of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_War_II" title="World War II">Second World War</a>.
</p>

<p>The so-called "<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pacification_of_Libya" title="Pacification of Libya">pacification of Libya</a>" by the Italians resulted in mass deaths of the indigenous people in Cyrenaica, killing approximately one quarter of Cyrenaica\'s population of 225,000.<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Libya#cite_note-54">[51]</a> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ilan_Papp%C3%A9" title="Ilan Pappé">Ilan Pappé</a> estimates that between 1928 and 1932 the Italian military "killed half the Bedouin population (directly or through disease and starvation in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italian_concentration_camps_in_Libya" title="Italian concentration camps in Libya">Italian concentration camps in Libya</a>)."<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Libya#cite_note-55">[52]</a>
</p>

<p>In 1934, Italy combined <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyrenaica" title="Cyrenaica">Cyrenaica</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tripolitania" title="Tripolitania">Tripolitania</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fezzan" title="Fezzan">Fezzan</a> and adopted the name "Libya" (used by the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ancient_Greece" title="Ancient Greece">Ancient Greeks</a> for all of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Africa" title="North Africa">North Africa</a> except <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Egypt" title="Egypt">Egypt</a>) for the unified colony, with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tripoli,_Libya" title="Tripoli, Libya">Tripoli</a> as its <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capital_city" title="Capital city">capital</a>.<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Libya#cite_note-56">[53]</a> The Italians emphasised infrastructure improvements and public works. In particular, they greatly expanded Libyan railway and road networks from 1934 to 1940, building hundreds of kilometres of new roads and railways and encouraging the establishment of new industries and dozens of new agricultural villages.
</p>

<p>In June 1940, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Military_history_of_Italy_during_World_War_II" title="Military history of Italy during World War II">Italy entered World War II</a>. Libya became the setting for the hard-fought <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_African_Campaign" title="North African Campaign">North African Campaign</a> that ultimately ended in defeat for Italy and its <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Afrika_Korps" title="Afrika Korps">German ally</a> in 1943. From 1943 to 1951, Libya was under <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allied_occupation_of_Libya" title="Allied occupation of Libya">Allied occupation</a>. The British military <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Military_Administration_(Libya)" title="British Military Administration (Libya)">administered</a> the two former Italian Libyan provinces of Tripolitana and Cyrenaïca, while the French <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_Fezzan" title="French Fezzan">administered</a> the province of Fezzan. In 1944, Idris returned from exile in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cairo" title="Cairo">Cairo</a> but declined to resume permanent residence in Cyrenaica until the removal of some aspects of foreign control in 1947.

<p>A national assembly crafted a constitution that established a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monarchy" title="Monarchy">monarchy</a> and extended an offer for the throne to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Idris_of_Libya" title="Idris of Libya">Sayyid Idris</a>, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emir_of_Cyrenaica" title="Emir of Cyrenaica">Emir of Cyrenaica</a>.<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Libya#cite_note-:5-58">[55]</a> Sayyid Idris held the esteemed position as the leader of the influential <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Senusiyya" title="Senusiyya">Senussi religious brotherhood</a>, which was founded by his grandfather in the preceding century as a response to Western influence in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arab_world" title="Arab world">Arab world</a>.<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Libya#cite_note-:5-58">[55]</a> This devout Islamic movement garnered significant support from the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bedouin" title="Bedouin">desert Bedouin</a> and became a major political force in Libya. During the declining years of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ottoman_Empire" title="Ottoman Empire">Ottoman Empire</a>, it effectively governed the Libyan interior.<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Libya#cite_note-:5-58">[55]</a>
Born in an oasis in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyrenaica" title="Cyrenaica">Cyrenaica</a> in 1890, Sayyid Idris assumed leadership of the Senussi at a young age. He spent a considerable period of exile in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Egypt" title="Egypt">Egypt</a> under Italian rule and returned to Libya after the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Axis_powers" title="Axis powers">Axis powers</a> were ousted in 1943.<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Libya#cite_note-:5-58">[55]</a> On 24 December 1951, as King Idris I, he addressed the nation via radio from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benghazi" title="Benghazi">Benghazi</a>.<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Libya#cite_note-:5-58">[55]</a> On 21 November 1949, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations_General_Assembly" title="United Nations General Assembly">UN General Assembly</a> passed a resolution stating that Libya should become independent before 1 January 1952.<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Libya#cite_note-:3-59">[56]</a> Idris represented Libya in the subsequent UN negotiations. By 24 December 1951, Libya declared its independence as the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kingdom_of_Libya" title="Kingdom of Libya">United Kingdom of Libya</a>, a constitutional and hereditary <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monarchy" title="Monarchy">monarchy</a> under King <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Idris_I_of_Libya" title="Idris I of Libya">Idris</a>.<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Libya#cite_note-:4-60">[57]</a>
</p>

<p>However, the new kingdom faced challenging prospects.<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Libya#cite_note-:5-58">[55]</a> It lacked significant industry and agricultural resources.<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Libya#cite_note-:5-58">[55]</a> The kingdom\'s primary exports consisted of hides, wool, horses, and ostrich feathers.<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Libya#cite_note-:5-58">[55]</a> Despite having one of the lowest income per capita figures globally, it also suffered from one of the highest illiteracy rates.<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Libya#cite_note-:5-58">[55]</a> King Idris I, already in his sixties, had no direct heir to succeed him.<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Libya#cite_note-:5-58">[55]</a> His cousin, whom he had married in 1932, reportedly experienced numerous miscarriages, and their son, born in 1953, tragically died shortly after birth.<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Libya#cite_note-:5-58">[55]</a> Crown Prince Rida, Idris\'s brother, was the designated heir, but the royal family was riddled with incessant disputes.<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Libya#cite_note-:5-58">[55]</a> King Idris\'s devout Muslim piety, which solidified his support among the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bedouin" title="Bedouin">Bedouin population</a>, clashed with the modernising and urban intellectual currents in Libya.<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Libya#cite_note-:5-58">[55]</a> To address the rivalry between <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyrenaica" title="Cyrenaica">Cyrenaica</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tripolitania" title="Tripolitania">Tripolitania</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benghazi" title="Benghazi">Benghazi</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tripoli,_Libya" title="Tripoli, Libya">Tripoli</a> alternated as the capital every two years.
</p>

<p>The swift emergence of a large number of bureaucrats resulted in a costly royal government.<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Libya#cite_note-:5-58">[55]</a> The discovery of significant <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oil_reserves" title="Oil reserves">oil reserves</a> in 1959 and the subsequent income from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Petroleum" title="Petroleum">petroleum</a> sales enabled one of the world\'s poorest nations to establish an extremely wealthy state.<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Libya#cite_note-:4-60">[57]</a> Although oil drastically improved the Libyan government\'s finances, popular resentment began to build over the increased concentration of the nation\'s wealth in the hands of King Idris and the national elite.<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Libya#cite_note-:3-59">[56]</a><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Libya#cite_note-:4-60">[57]</a> This discontent continued to mount with the rise of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nasserism" title="Nasserism">Nasserism</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arab_nationalism" title="Arab nationalism">Arab nationalism</a> throughout <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Africa" title="North Africa">North Africa</a> and the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middle_East" title="Middle East">Middle East</a>, that inspire many anti-royal coups across the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arab_world" title="Arab world">Arab world</a>.<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Libya#cite_note-:4-60">[57]</a>

<p>On 1 September 1969, a group of rebel military officers led by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muammar_Gaddafi" title="Muammar Gaddafi">Muammar Gaddafi</a> launched a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1969_Libyan_coup_d%27%C3%A9tat" title="1969 Libyan coup d\'état">coup d\'état against King Idris</a>, which became known as the Al Fateh Revolution.<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Libya#cite_note-SalakLibya-61">[58]</a><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Libya#cite_note-:6-62">[59]</a> Gaddafi was referred to as the "<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brotherly_Leader_and_Guide_of_the_Revolution" title="Brotherly Leader and Guide of the Revolution">Brother Leader and Guide of the Revolution</a>" in government statements and the official Libyan press.<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Libya#cite_note-63">[60]</a><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Libya#cite_note-:6-62">[59]</a> He began dominating history and politics of Libya for the next four decades.<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Libya#cite_note-:6-62">[59]</a> Moving to reduce Italian influence, in October 1970 all Italian-owned assets were expropriated and the 12,000-strong <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italian_settlers_in_Libya" title="Italian settlers in Libya">Italian community</a> was <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1970_expulsion_of_Italians_from_Libya" title="1970 expulsion of Italians from Libya">expelled</a> from Libya alongside the smaller community of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_the_Jews_in_Libya" title="History of the Jews in Libya">Italian Libyan Jews</a>.<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Libya#cite_note-:6-62">[59]</a> The day became a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_holiday" title="Public holiday">national holiday</a> known as "<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Day_of_Revenge" title="Day of Revenge">Day of Revenge</a>";<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Libya#cite_note-:6-62">[59]</a> it was later renamed the "Day of Friendship" because of an improvement in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italy%E2%80%93Libya_relations" title="Italy–Libya relations">Italy–Libya relations</a>.<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Libya#cite_note-64">[61]</a>
</p>

<p>Libya\'s increase in prosperity was accompanied by increased internal political repression, and political dissent was made illegal under Law 75 of 1973.<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Libya#cite_note-GlobalEdge-65">[62]</a> Widespread surveillance of the population was carried out through Gaddafi\'s Revolutionary Committees.<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Libya#cite_note-Gaddafiunrepentant-66">[63]</a><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Libya#cite_note-GlobalEdge-65">[62]</a><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Libya#cite_note-67">[64]</a> Gaddafi also wanted to ease the strict social restrictions imposed on women by the previous regime, establishing the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Revolutionary_Women%27s_Formation" title="Revolutionary Women\'s Formation">Revolutionary Women\'s Formation</a> to encourage reform.<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Libya#cite_note-GlobalEdge-65">[62]</a> In 1970, a law was introduced affirming equality of the sexes and wage parity.<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Libya#cite_note-GlobalEdge-65">[62]</a> In 1971, Gaddafi sponsored the creation of a Libyan General Women\'s Federation.<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Libya#cite_note-GlobalEdge-65">[62]</a> In 1972, a law was passed criminalising the marriage of girls under the age of sixteen and making the woman\'s consent a necessary prerequisite for a marriage.<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Libya#cite_note-68">[65]</a>
</p>

<p>
On 25 October 1975, a coup attempt was launched by a group of 20 military officers, mostly from the city of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Misrata" title="Misrata">Misrata</a>.<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Libya#cite_note-69">[66]</a> This resulted in the arrest and executions of the coup plotters.<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Libya#cite_note-70">[67]</a> In March 1977, Libya officially became the "Socialist People\'s Libyan Arab Jamahiriya".<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Libya#cite_note-GlobalEdge-65">[62]</a> Gaddafi officially passed power to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_People%27s_Committee" title="General People\'s Committee">General People\'s Committees</a> and henceforth claimed to be no more than a symbolic figurehead.<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Libya#cite_note-71">[68]</a><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Libya#cite_note-GlobalEdge-65">[62]</a> The new <i>jamahiriya</i> (Arab for "republic") governance structure he established was officially referred to as "<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Direct_democracy" title="Direct democracy">direct democracy</a>".<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Libya#cite_note-72">[69]</a> Gaddafi, in his vision of democratic government and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Political_philosophy" title="Political philosophy">political philosophy</a>, published <i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Green_Book_(Gaddafi)" title="The Green Book (Gaddafi)">The Green Book</a></i> in 1975. His short book inscribed a representative mix of utopian socialism and Arab nationalism with a streak of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bedouin" title="Bedouin">Bedouin</a> supremacy.</p>

<p>In February 1977, Libya started delivering military supplies to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goukouni_Oueddei" title="Goukouni Oueddei">Goukouni Oueddei</a> and the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/People%27s_Armed_Forces" title="People\'s Armed Forces">People\'s Armed Forces</a> in Chad.<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Libya#cite_note-GlobalEdge-65">[62]</a> The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chadian%E2%80%93Libyan_War" title="Chadian–Libyan War">Chadian–Libyan War</a> began in earnest when Libya\'s support of rebel forces in northern Chad escalated into an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toyota_war" title="Toyota war">invasion</a>.<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Libya#cite_note-GlobalEdge-65">[62]</a> Later that same year, Libya and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Egypt" title="Egypt">Egypt</a> fought a four-day border war that came to be known as the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Egyptian%E2%80%93Libyan_War" title="Egyptian–Libyan War">Egyptian–Libyan War</a>.<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Libya#cite_note-GlobalEdge-65">[62]</a> Both nations agreed to a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ceasefire" title="Ceasefire">ceasefire</a> under the mediation of the Algerian president <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Houari_Boum%C3%A9di%C3%A8ne" title="Houari Boumédiène">Houari Boumédiène</a>.<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Libya#cite_note-73">[70]</a> Hundreds of Libyans lost their lives in the country\'s support for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Idi_Amin" title="Idi Amin">Idi Amin</a>\'s <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uganda" title="Uganda">Uganda</a> in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uganda%E2%80%93Tanzania_War" title="Uganda–Tanzania War">its war against Tanzania</a>.<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Libya#cite_note-GlobalEdge-65">[62]</a> Gaddafi financed various other groups from anti-nuclear movements to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australia" title="Australia">Australian</a> trade unions.<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Libya#cite_note-74">[71]</a> On 2 March 1977, Libya officially became the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_Libya_under_Muammar_Gaddafi#Great_Socialist_People\'s_Libyan_Arab_Jamahiriya_(1977%E2%80%932011)" title="History of Libya under Muammar Gaddafi">Great Socialist People\'s Libyan Arab Jamahiriya</a>.<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Libya#cite_note-75">[72]</a>

<p>Libya adopted its plain green national flag on 19 November 1977.<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Libya#cite_note-GlobalEdge-65">[62]</a> The country had the only plain-coloured flag in the world until 2011, when Libya adopted <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flag_of_Libya" title="Flag of Libya">its current flag</a>.[<i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed" title="Wikipedia:Citation needed">citation needed</a></i>] From 1977 onward, per capita income in the country rose to more than US$11,000, the fifth-highest in Africa,<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Libya#cite_note-76">[73]</a> while the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_Development_Index" title="Human Development Index">Human Development Index</a> became the highest in Africa and greater than that of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saudi_Arabia" title="Saudi Arabia">Saudi Arabia</a>.<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Libya#cite_note-dailynews-77">[74]</a> This was achieved without borrowing any foreign loans, keeping Libya <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_sovereign_states_by_public_debt" title="List of sovereign states by public debt">debt-free</a>.<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Libya#cite_note-78">[75]</a> The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Manmade_River" title="Great Manmade River">Great Manmade River</a> was also built to allow free access to fresh water across large parts of the country.<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Libya#cite_note-dailynews-77">[74]</a> In addition, financial support was provided for university scholarships and employment programs.<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Libya#cite_note-79">[76]</a> Much of Libya\'s income from oil, which soared in the 1970s, was spent on arms purchases and on sponsoring dozens of paramilitaries and terrorist groups around the world.<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Libya#cite_note-80">[77]</a><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Libya#cite_note-81">[78]</a><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Libya#cite_note-82">[79]</a>

<p>Pro-Gaddafi forces were able to respond militarily to rebel pushes in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tripolitania" title="Tripolitania">Western Libya</a> and launched a counterattack along the coast toward Benghazi, the <i>de facto</i> centre of the uprising.<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Libya#cite_note-90">[87]</a> The town of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zawiya,_Libya" title="Zawiya, Libya">Zawiya</a>, 48 kilometres (30 mi) from Tripoli, was bombarded by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Libyan_Air_Force_(1951%E2%80%932011)" title="Libyan Air Force (1951–2011)">air force planes</a> and army tanks and seized by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Armed_Forces_of_the_Libyan_Arab_Jamahiriya" title="Armed Forces of the Libyan Arab Jamahiriya">Jamahiriya troops</a>, "exercising a level of brutality not yet seen in the conflict."<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Libya#cite_note-91">[88]</a> Organizations of the United Nations, including <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations_Secretary_General" title="United Nations Secretary General">United Nations Secretary General</a> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ban_Ki-moon" title="Ban Ki-moon">Ban Ki-moon</a><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Libya#cite_note-92">[89]</a> and the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations_Human_Rights_Council" title="United Nations Human Rights Council">United Nations Human Rights Council</a>, condemned the crackdown as violating international law, with the latter body expelling Libya outright in an unprecedented action.<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Libya#cite_note-93">[90]</a><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Libya#cite_note-94">[91]</a> On 17 March 2011, the UN Security Council passed <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations_Security_Council_Resolution_1973" title="United Nations Security Council Resolution 1973">Resolution 1973</a>,<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Libya#cite_note-95">[92]</a> with a 10–0 vote and five abstentions including <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russia" title="Russia">Russia</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China" title="China">China</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India" title="India">India</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brazil" title="Brazil">Brazil</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germany" title="Germany">Germany</a>.

</p>

<p>In the weeks that followed, U.S. American forces were in the forefront of NATO operations against Libya. More than 8,000 US personnel in warships and aircraft were deployed in the area. At least 3,000 targets were struck in 14,202 strike sorties, 716 of them in Tripoli and 492 in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brega" title="Brega">Brega</a>.<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Libya#cite_note-98">[95]</a> The U.S. air offensive included flights of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northrop_B-2_Spirit" title="Northrop B-2 Spirit">B-2 stealth bombers</a>, each bomber armed with sixteen 2000-pound bombs, flying out of and returning to their base in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Missouri" title="Missouri">Missouri</a>.<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Libya#cite_note-99">[96]</a> The support provided by the NATO air forces contributed to the ultimate success of the revolution.<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Libya#cite_note-100">[97]</a> By 22 August 2011, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Liberation_Army_(Libya)" title="National Liberation Army (Libya)">rebel fighters</a> had entered Tripoli and occupied <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martyrs%27_Square,_Tripoli" title="Martyrs\' Square, Tripoli">Green Square</a>,<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Libya#cite_note-Richburg-101">[98]</a> which they renamed Martyrs\' Square in honour of those killed since 17 February 2011.

<p>Following the defeat of loyalist forces, Libya was torn among numerous rival, armed militias affiliated with distinct regions, cities and tribes, while the central government had been weak and unable to effectively exert its authority over the country. Competing militias pitted themselves against each other in a political struggle between <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islamism" title="Islamism">Islamist</a> politicians and their opponents.<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Libya#cite_note-104">[101]</a> On 7 July 2012, Libyans held their first parliamentary elections since the end of the former regime. On 8 August, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Transitional_Council" title="National Transitional Council">National Transitional Council</a> officially handed power over to the wholly elected <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_National_Congress" title="General National Congress">General National Congress</a>, which was then tasked with the formation of an interim government and the drafting of a new <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Libyan_interim_Constitutional_Declaration" title="Libyan interim Constitutional Declaration">Libyan Constitution</a> to be approved in a general <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Next_Libyan_referendum" title="Next Libyan referendum">referendum</a>.<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Libya#cite_note-Esam-8-Aug-105">[102]</a> On 25 August 2012, in what Reuters reported as "the most blatant sectarian attack" since the end of the civil war, unnamed organised assailants bulldozed a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sufism" title="Sufism">Sufi</a> mosque with graves in the centre of the Libyan capital <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tripoli,_Libya" title="Tripoli, Libya">Tripoli</a>. It was the second such razing of a Sufi site in two days.<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Libya#cite_note-106">[103]</a> Numerous acts of vandalism and destruction of heritage were carried out by suspected Islamist militias, including the removal of the Nude Gazelle Statue and the destruction and desecration of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_War_II" title="World War II">World War II</a>-era British grave sites near <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benghazi" title="Benghazi">Benghazi</a>.<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Libya#cite_note-107">[104]</a><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Libya#cite_note-108">[105]</a> Many other cases of heritage vandalism were reported to be carried out by Islamist-related radical militias and mobs that either destroyed, robbed, or looted a number of historic sites.
</p>

<p>On 11 September 2012, Islamist militants mounted an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2012_Benghazi_attack" title="2012 Benghazi attack">attack on the American diplomatic compound in Benghazi</a>,<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Libya#cite_note-109">[106]</a> killing the U.S. ambassador to Libya, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._Christopher_Stevens" title="J. Christopher Stevens">J. Christopher Stevens</a>, and three others. The incident generated outrage in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States" title="United States">United States</a> and Libya.<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Libya#cite_note-110">[107]</a> On 7 October 2012, Libya\'s Prime Minister-elect <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mustafa_A._G._Abushagur" title="Mustafa A. G. Abushagur">Mustafa A.G. Abushagur</a> was ousted after failing a second time to win parliamentary approval for a new cabinet.<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Libya#cite_note-111">[108]</a><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Libya#cite_note-112">[109]</a><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Libya#cite_note-113">[110]</a> On 14 October 2012, the General National Congress elected former GNC member and human rights lawyer <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ali_Zeidan" title="Ali Zeidan">Ali Zeidan</a> as prime minister-designate.<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Libya#cite_note-114">[111]</a> Zeidan was sworn in after his cabinet was approved by the GNC.<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Libya#cite_note-115">[112]</a><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Libya#cite_note-116">[113]</a> On 11 March 2014, after having been ousted by the GNC for his inability to halt a rogue oil shipment,<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Libya#cite_note-nyt-117">[114]</a> Prime Minister Zeidan stepped down, and was replaced by Prime Minister <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abdullah_al-Thani" title="Abdullah al-Thani">Abdullah al-Thani</a>.<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Libya#cite_note-118">[115]</a>
</p>

<p>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_Libyan_Civil_War" title="Second Libyan Civil War">Second Civil War</a> began in May 2014 following fighting between rival parliaments with tribal militias and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jihad" title="Jihad">jihadist</a> groups soon taking advantage of the power vacuum. Most notably, radical Islamist fighters seized <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Derna,_Libya" title="Derna, Libya">Derna</a> in 2014 and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sirte" title="Sirte">Sirte</a> in 2015 in the name of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islamic_State" title="Islamic State">Islamic State</a>. In February 2015, neighbouring <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Egypt" title="Egypt">Egypt</a> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/February_2015_Egyptian_airstrikes_in_Libya" title="February 2015 Egyptian airstrikes in Libya">launched airstrikes</a> against IS in support of the Tobruk government.<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Libya#cite_note-119">[116]</a><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Libya#cite_note-120">[117]</a><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Libya#cite_note-121">[118]</a> In June 2014, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2014_Libyan_parliamentary_election" title="2014 Libyan parliamentary election">elections were held</a> to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/House_of_Representatives_(Libya)" title="House of Representatives (Libya)">House of Representatives</a>, a new legislative body intended to take over from the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_National_Congress" title="General National Congress">General National Congress</a>. The elections were marred by violence and low turnout, with voting stations closed in some areas.<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Libya#cite_note-Jawad-122">[119]</a> Secularists and liberals did well in the elections, to the consternation of Islamist lawmakers in the GNC, who reconvened and declared a continuing mandate for the GNC, refusing to recognise the new House of Representatives.<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Libya#cite_note-123">[120]</a> Armed supporters of the General National Congress occupied Tripoli, forcing the newly elected parliament to flee to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tobruk" title="Tobruk">Tobruk</a>.<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Libya#cite_note-WPost_Aug._24-124">[121]</a><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Libya#cite_note-guardian-20140909-125">[122]</a>
</p>

<p>In January 2015, meetings were held with the aim to find a peaceful agreement between the rival parties in Libya. The so-called Geneva-Ghadames talks were supposed to bring the GNC and the Tobruk government together at one table to find a solution of the internal conflict. However, the GNC actually never participated, a sign that internal division not only affected the "Tobruk Camp", but also the "Tripoli Camp". Meanwhile, terrorism within Libya steadily increased, also affecting neighbouring countries. The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bardo_National_Museum_attack" title="Bardo National Museum attack">terrorist attack against the Bardo Museum</a> in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tunisia" title="Tunisia">Tunisia</a> on 18 March 2015 was reportedly carried out by two Libyan-trained militants.<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Libya#cite_note-126">[123]</a> During 2015 an extended series of diplomatic meetings and peace negotiations were supported by the United Nations, as conducted by the Special Representative of the Secretary-General (SRSG), Spanish diplomat <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bernardino_Le%C3%B3n" title="Bernardino León">Bernardino León</a>.<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Libya#cite_note-127">[124]</a><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Libya#cite_note-128">[125]</a> UN support for the SRSG-led process of dialogue carried on in addition to the usual work of the United Nations Support Mission in Libya (UNSMIL).<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Libya#cite_note-129">[126]</a> In July 2015 SRSG Leon reported to the UN Security Council on the progress of the negotiations, which at that point had just achieved a political agreement on 11 July setting out "a comprehensive framework... includ[ing] guiding principles... institutions and decision-making mechanisms to guide the transition until the adoption of a permanent constitution."
Talks, negotiations and dialogue continued on during mid-2015 at various international locations, culminating at Skhirat in Morocco in early September.<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Libya#cite_note-130">[127]</a><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Libya#cite_note-131">[128]</a>
</p>

<p>Also in 2015, as part of the ongoing support from the international community, the UN Human Rights Council requested a report about the Libyan situation<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Libya#cite_note-132">[129]</a><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Libya#cite_note-133">[130]</a> and the High Commissioner for Human Rights, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zeid_bin_Ra%27ad" title="Zeid bin Ra\'ad">Zeid Ra\'ad Al Hussein</a>, established an investigative body (OIOL) to report on human rights and rebuilding the Libyan justice system.<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Libya#cite_note-134">[131]</a> Chaos-ridden Libya emerged as a major transit point for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2015_European_migrant_crisis" title="2015 European migrant crisis">people trying to reach Europe</a>. Between 2013 and 2018, nearly 700,000 migrants reached Italy by boat, many of them from Libya.<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Libya#cite_note-135">[132]</a><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Libya#cite_note-136">[133]</a> In May 2018 Libya\'s rival leaders agreed to hold parliamentary and presidential elections following a meeting in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris" title="Paris">Paris</a>.<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Libya#cite_note-137">[134]</a> In April 2019, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Khalifa_Haftar" title="Khalifa Haftar">Khalifa Haftar</a> launched <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Libya_campaign" title="Western Libya campaign">Operation Flood of Dignity</a>, in an offensive by the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Libyan_National_Army" title="Libyan National Army">Libyan National Army</a> aimed to seize Western territories from the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Government_of_National_Accord" title="Government of National Accord">Government of National Accord</a> (GNA).<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Libya#cite_note-138">[135]</a> In June 2019, forces allied to Libya\'s UN-recognised Government of National Accord successfully captured <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gharyan" title="Gharyan">Gharyan</a>, a strategic town where military commander Khalifa Haftar and his fighters were based. According to a spokesman for GNA forces, Mustafa al-Mejii, dozens of LNA fighters under Haftar were killed, while at least 18 were taken prisoner.<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Libya#cite_note-139">[136]</a>
</p>

<p>In March 2020, Prime Minister of the GNA <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fayez_al-Sarraj" title="Fayez al-Sarraj">Fayez Al-Sarraj</a> commenced Operation Peace Storm. The government initiated the bid in response to the state of assaults carried by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Field_Marshal" title="Field Marshal">Field Marshal</a> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Khalifa_Haftar" title="Khalifa Haftar">Haftar</a>\'s <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Libyan_National_Army" title="Libyan National Army">LNA</a>. "We are a legitimate, civilian government that respects its obligations to the international community, but is committed primarily to its people and has an obligation to protect its citizens," Sarraj said in line with his decision.<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Libya#cite_note-140">[137]</a> On 28 August 2020, the <i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BBC" title="BBC">BBC</a> Africa Eye</i> and <i>BBC Arabic Documentaries</i> revealed that a drone operated by the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Arab_Emirates" title="United Arab Emirates">United Arab Emirates</a> (UAE) killed 26 young cadets at a military academy in Tripoli, on 4 January. Most of the cadets were teenagers and none of them were armed. The Chinese-made drone <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CAIG_Wing_Loong_II" title="CAIG Wing Loong II">Wing Loong II</a> fired Blue Arrow 7 missile, which was operated from UAE-run Al-Khadim Libyan air base. In February, these drones stationed in Libya were moved to an air base near <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Siwa_Oasis" title="Siwa Oasis">Siwa</a> in the western Egyptian desert.<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Libya#cite_note-141">[138]</a> <i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Guardian" title="The Guardian">The Guardian</a></i> probed and discovered the blatant violation of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations" title="United Nations">UN</a> arms embargo by the UAE and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turkey" title="Turkey">Turkey</a> on 7 October 2020. As per the reporting, both the nations sent large-scale military cargo planes to Libya in support of their respective parties.<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Libya#cite_note-142">[139]</a> On 23 October 2020, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Libyan_peace_process" title="Libyan peace process">a permanent ceasefire</a> was signed to end the war.<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Libya#cite_note-143">[140]</a>

<p>Natural hazards come in the form of hot, dry, dust-laden <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sirocco" title="Sirocco">sirocco</a> (known in Libya as the <i>gibli</i>). This is a southern wind blowing from one to four days in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spring_(season)" title="Spring (season)">spring</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autumn" title="Autumn">autumn</a>.

</p>

<p>Libya was a pioneer state in North Africa in species protection, with the creation in 1975 of the El Kouf protected area. The fall of Muammar Gaddafi\'s regime favoured intense <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poaching" title="Poaching">poaching</a>: "Before the fall of Gaddafi even hunting rifles were forbidden. But since 2011, poaching has been carried out with weapons of war and sophisticated vehicles in which one can find up to 200 gazelle heads killed by militiamen who hunt to pass the time. We are also witnessing the emergence of hunters with no connection to the tribes that traditionally practice hunting. They shoot everything they find, even during the breeding season. More than 500,000 birds are killed in this way each year, when protected areas have been seized by tribal chiefs who have appropriated them. The animals that used to live there have all disappeared, hunted when they are edible or released when they are not," explains zoologist Khaled Ettaieb.<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Libya#cite_note-159">[156]</a>

<h3>Libyan Desert</h3><p>
Main article: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Libyan_Desert" title="Libyan Desert">Libyan Desert</a></p>

<p>The Libyan Desert, which covers most of Libya, is one of the most arid and sun-baked places on Earth.<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Libya#cite_note-SalakLibya-61">[58]</a> In places, decades may pass without seeing any rainfall at all, and even in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Highland_(geography)" title="Highland (geography)">highlands</a> rainfall seldom happens, once every 5–10 years. At <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gabal_El_Uweinat" title="Gabal El Uweinat">Uweinat</a>, as of 2006<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Libya&amp;action=edit">[update]</a> the last recorded rainfall was in September 1998.<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Libya#cite_note-Libdesert-161">[158]</a>
</p>

<p>Likewise, the temperature in the Libyan Desert can be extreme; on 13 September 1922, the town of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%27Aziziya" title="\'Aziziya">\'Aziziya</a>, which is located southwest of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tripoli,_Libya" title="Tripoli, Libya">Tripoli</a>, recorded an air temperature of 58 °C (136.4 °F), considered to be a world record.<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Libya#cite_note-162">[159]</a><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Libya#cite_note-Death_Valley-163">[160]</a><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Libya#cite_note-El_Azizia-164">[161]</a> In September 2012, however, the world record figure of 58 °C was determined to be invalid by the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Meteorological_Organization" title="World Meteorological Organization">World Meteorological Organization</a>.<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Libya#cite_note-Death_Valley-163">[160]</a><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Libya#cite_note-El_Azizia-164">[161]</a><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Libya#cite_note-165">[162]</a>
</p>

<p>There are a few scattered uninhabited small oases, usually linked to the major depressions, where water can be found by digging to a few feet in depth. In the west there is a widely dispersed group of oases in unconnected shallow depressions, the Kufra group, consisting of Tazerbo, Rebianae and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kufra" title="Kufra">Kufra</a>.<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Libya#cite_note-Libdesert-161">[158]</a> Aside from the scarps, the general flatness is only interrupted by a series of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plateau" title="Plateau">plateaus</a> and massifs near the centre of the Libyan Desert, around the convergence of the Egyptian-Sudanese-Libyan borders.
</p>

<p>Slightly further to the south are the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Massif" title="Massif">massifs</a> of Arkenu, Uweinat, and Kissu. These <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Granite" title="Granite">granite</a> mountains are ancient, having formed long before the sandstones surrounding them. Arkenu and Western Uweinat are ring complexes very similar to those in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A%C3%AFr_Mountains" title="Aïr Mountains">Aïr Mountains</a>. Eastern Uweinat (the highest point in the Libyan Desert) is a raised sandstone plateau adjacent to the granite part further west.<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Libya#cite_note-Libdesert-161">[158]</a>
</p>

<p>The plain to the north of Uweinat is dotted with eroded volcanic features. With the discovery of oil in the 1950s also came the discovery of a massive <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aquifer" title="Aquifer">aquifer</a> underneath much of Libya. The water in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nubian_Sandstone_Aquifer_System" title="Nubian Sandstone Aquifer System">Nubian Sandstone Aquifer System</a> pre-dates the last <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ice_age" title="Ice age">ice ages</a> and the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sahara" title="Sahara">Sahara Desert</a> itself.<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Libya#cite_note-166">[163]</a> This area also contains the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arkenu_structures" title="Arkenu structures">Arkenu structures</a>, which were once thought to be two impact craters.<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Libya#cite_note-CigoliniOthers2012a-167">[164]</a>

<p>Libya\'s <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Armed_Forces_of_the_Libyan_Arab_Jamahiriya" title="Armed Forces of the Libyan Arab Jamahiriya">previous national army</a> was defeated in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_Libyan_Civil_War" title="First Libyan Civil War">First Libyan Civil War</a> and disbanded.

Led by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Khalifa_Haftar" title="Khalifa Haftar">Khalifa Haftar</a>, it controls much of eastern Libya.<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Libya#cite_note-216">[213]</a> In May 2012, an estimated 35,000 personnel had joined its ranks.<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Libya#cite_note-nytimes-217">[214]</a> The internationally recognised <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Government_of_National_Accord" title="Government of National Accord">Government of National Accord</a> established in 2015 had <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Libyan_Army" title="Libyan Army">its own army</a> that replaced the LNA, consisting largely of undisciplined and disorganised militia groups.
</p>

<p>As of November 2012, it was deemed to be still in the embryonic stage of development.<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Libya#cite_note-218">[215]</a> President <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mohammed_Magariaf" title="Mohammed Magariaf">Mohammed Magariaf</a> promised that empowering the army and police force was the government\'s biggest priority in 2012.<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Libya#cite_note-219">[216]</a> President Megarif also ordered that all of the country\'s militias to come under government authority or disband.<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Libya#cite_note-220">[217]</a>
</p>

<p>Militias had refused to be integrated into a central security force by February 2013.<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Libya#cite_note-hangover-221">[218]</a> Many of the militias were disciplined, but the most powerful of them answered only to the executive councils of various Libyan cities.<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Libya#cite_note-hangover-221">[218]</a> The militias made up the so-called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Libya_Shield_Force" title="Libya Shield Force">Libya Shield Force</a>, a parallel national force, which operated at the request, rather than at the order, of the defence ministry.<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Libya#cite_note-hangover-221">[218]</a>

<p>The Libyan economy depends primarily upon revenues from the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Petroleum_industry" title="Petroleum industry">oil sector</a>, which account for over half of GDP and 97% of exports.<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Libya#cite_note-star-oil-225">[222]</a> Libya holds the largest proven oil reserves in Africa and is an important contributor to the global supply of light, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sweet_crude" title="Sweet crude">sweet crude</a>.<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Libya#cite_note-eia-libya-226">[223]</a> During 2010, when oil averaged at $80 a barrel, oil production accounted for 54% of GDP.<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Libya#cite_note-227">[224]</a> Apart from petroleum, the other natural resources are natural gas and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gypsum" title="Gypsum">gypsum</a>.<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Libya#cite_note-opec-libya-228">[225]</a> The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Monetary_Fund" title="International Monetary Fund">International Monetary Fund</a> estimated Libya\'s real GDP growth at 122% in 2012 and 16.7% in 2013, after a 60% plunge in 2011.<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Libya#cite_note-star-oil-225">[222]</a>
</p>

<p>In 2023 Libya emitted around 23.77 million tonnes of greenhouse gases, about 0.17% of the world\'s total emissions. However, the nation ranked as the 21st highest emitter per capita globally and the highest in Africa, at just over 13 tonnes per person.<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Libya#cite_note-229">[226]</a> Libya was slow to join climate efforts, signing the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations_Framework_Convention_on_Climate_Change" title="United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change">United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change</a> (UNFCCC) in 2016 and the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris_Agreement" title="Paris Agreement">Paris Climate Agreement</a> in 2021.<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Libya#cite_note-:10-230">[227]</a> However, as of 2024, Libya has not ratified the Paris Agreement and submitted its <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nationally_determined_contribution" title="Nationally determined contribution">Nationally Determined Contributions</a> (NDCs), and has made little progress toward the development of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Climate_change_adaptation" title="Climate change adaptation">climate change adaptation</a> plans.<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Libya#cite_note-:11-231">[228]</a><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Libya#cite_note-232">[229]</a>

<p>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Bank" title="World Bank">World Bank</a> defines Libya as an \'Upper Middle Income Economy\', along with only seven other African countries.<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Libya#cite_note-233">[230]</a> Substantial revenues from the energy sector, coupled with a small population, give Libya one of the highest per capita GDPs in Africa.

<p>Libya faces many structural problems including a lack of institutions, weak governance, and chronic <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Structural_unemployment" title="Structural unemployment">structural unemployment</a>.<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Libya#cite_note-imf-survey-235">[232]</a> The economy displays a lack of economic diversification and significant reliance on immigrant labour.<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Libya#cite_note-ilo-libya-236">[233]</a> Libya has traditionally relied on unsustainably high levels of public sector hiring to create employment.<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Libya#cite_note-african-outlook-237">[234]</a> In the mid-2000s, the government employed about 70% of all national employees.<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Libya#cite_note-ilo-libya-236">[233]</a>
</p>

<p>Unemployment rose from 8% in 2008 to 21% in 2009, according to the census figures.<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Libya#cite_note-238">[235]</a> According to an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arab_League" title="Arab League">Arab League</a> report, based on data from 2010, unemployment for women stands at 18% while for the figure for men is 21%, making Libya the only Arab country where there are more unemployed men than women.<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Libya#cite_note-239">[236]</a> Libya has high levels of social inequality, high rates of youth unemployment and regional economic disparities.<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Libya#cite_note-african-outlook-237">[234]</a> Water supply is also a problem, with some 28% of the population not having access to safe drinking water in 2000.<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Libya#cite_note-240">[237]</a>

<p>In 2007, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saif_al-Islam_Gaddafi" title="Saif al-Islam Gaddafi">Saif al-Islam Gaddafi</a>, the second-eldest son of Muammar Gaddafi, was involved in a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Green_development" title="Green development">green development</a> project called the Green Mountain Sustainable Development Area, which sought to bring tourism to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyrene,_Libya" title="Cyrene, Libya">Cyrene</a> and to preserve <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classical_Greece" title="Classical Greece">Greek</a> ruins in the area.<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Libya#cite_note-252">[249]</a> In August 2011, it was estimated that it would take at least 10 years to rebuild Libya\'s infrastructure. Even before the 2011 war, Libya\'s infrastructure was in a poor state due to "utter neglect" by Gaddafi\'s administration, according to the NTC.<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Libya#cite_note-253">[250]</a> By October 2012, the economy had recovered from the 2011 conflict, with oil production returning to near normal levels.<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Libya#cite_note-star-oil-225">[222]</a> Oil production was more than 1.6 million barrels per day before the war. By October 2012, the average oil production has surpassed 1.4 million bpd.<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Libya#cite_note-star-oil-225">[222]</a> The resumption of production was made possible due to the quick return of major Western companies, like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TotalEnergies" title="TotalEnergies">TotalEnergies</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eni" title="Eni">Eni</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Repsol" title="Repsol">Repsol</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wintershall" title="Wintershall">Wintershall</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Occidental_Petroleum" title="Occidental Petroleum">Occidental</a>.<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Libya#cite_note-star-oil-225">[222]</a> In 2016, an announcement from the company said the company aims 900,000 barrel per day in the next year.

</p>

<p>As of March 2024, Libya was actively promoting business development and encouraging both domestic and foreign investment. This strategic initiative is aimed at securing long-term economic stability and prosperity for Libya by diversifying its economic foundation. Embracing green industries like renewable energy, energy efficiency, sustainable agriculture, and eco-tourism holds the potential to generate fresh employment prospects across a spectrum of sectors, thereby addressing unemployment challenges, particularly among the youth demographic.<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Libya#cite_note-259">[256]</a>

<p>Libya is a large country with a relatively small population concentrated very narrowly along the coast.<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Libya#cite_note-260">[257]</a> Its population density is about 50 inhabitants per square kilometre (130/sq mi) in the two northern regions of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tripolitania" title="Tripolitania">Tripolitania</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyrenaica" title="Cyrenaica">Cyrenaica</a>, but falls to less than 1 inhabitant per square kilometre (2.6/sq mi) elsewhere. 90% of the people live along the coast in less than 10% of the area.
</p>

<p>About 88% of the population is urban, mostly concentrated in the three largest cities, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tripoli,_Libya" title="Tripoli, Libya">Tripoli</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benghazi" title="Benghazi">Benghazi</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Misrata" title="Misrata">Misrata</a>. Libya has a population of about 6.7 million,<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Libya#cite_note-UN_WPP-261">[258]</a><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Libya#cite_note-UN_WPP_2022-262">[259]</a> 27.7% of whom are under the age of 15.<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Libya#cite_note-spooks-263">[260]</a> In 1984 the population was 3.6 million, an increase from the 1.54 million reported in 1964.<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Libya#cite_note-264">[261]</a>
</p>

<p>The population of Libya is primarily of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arabs" title="Arabs">Arab</a> ancestry.<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Libya#cite_note-265">[262]</a> Arabs account for 92% of the population, while <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berbers" title="Berbers">Berbers</a> account for 5%, though other estimates put this percentage at 10%, representing approximately 600,000 people.<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Libya#cite_note-266">[263]</a><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Libya#cite_note-267">[264]</a> Among the Berber groups are the minority Berber populations of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zuwarah" title="Zuwarah">Zuwarah</a> and the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nafusa_Mountains" title="Nafusa Mountains">Nafusa Mountains</a>.

Libya is one of the world\'s most <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tribalism" title="Tribalism">tribal</a> countries. There are about 140 <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tribe" title="Tribe">tribes</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clan" title="Clan">clans</a> in Libya.<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Libya#cite_note-268">[265]</a> Also living in Libya are an estimated 750,000 Egyptian workers, down from more than 2 million prior to the overthrow of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muammar_Gaddafi" title="Muammar Gaddafi">Muammar Gaddafi</a> in 2011.<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Libya#cite_note-269">[266]</a>
</p>

<p>Family life is important for Libyan families, the majority of whom live in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tower_block" title="Tower block">apartment blocks</a> and other independent housing units, with modes of housing depending on their income and wealth. Although the Arab Libyans traditionally lived nomadic <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bedouin" title="Bedouin">Bedouin</a> lifestyles in tents, they have predominately settled in towns and cities.<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Libya#cite_note-270">[267]</a> Old ways of life are gradually fading out. A small number of Libyans still live in the desert as their families have done for centuries. Most of the population has occupations in industry and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tertiary_sector_of_the_economy" title="Tertiary sector of the economy">services</a>, and a small percentage is in agriculture.
</p>

<p>According to the UNHCR, there were around 8,000 registered refugees, 5,500 unregistered refugees, and 7,000 asylum seekers of various origins in Libya in January 2013. Additionally, 47,000 Libyan nationals were internally displaced and 46,570 were internally displaced returnees.<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Libya#cite_note-271">[268]</a>

<h3>Health</h3><p>
Main article: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_in_Libya" title="Health in Libya">Health in Libya</a>
</p>

<p>In 2010, spending on healthcare accounted for 3.88% of the country\'s GDP. In 2009, there were 18.71 physicians and 66.95 nurses per 10,000 inhabitants.<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Libya#cite_note-272">[269]</a> The life expectancy at birth was 74.95 years in 2011, or 72.44 years for males and 77.59 years for females.<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Libya#cite_note-273">[270]</a>
</p>

<p>In 2023, the Libyan health ministry announced the launch of the National Strategy for Primary Healthcare 2023–2028 to improve services provided by group clinics and health centres. A unique health number allotted to each citizen will facilitate access to medical records. Before Storm Daniel, the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs estimated that around 60,000 people were in need of humanitarian aid in Derna and environs. Since the storm many of the hospitals and primary health facilities in Derna and eastern Libya have been rendered partially or completely nonfunctional.<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Libya#cite_note-274">[271]</a>
</p>

<p>Libya\'s 2024 Global Hunger Index (GHI) score is 19.2, which indicates a moderate level of hunger. Libya ranks 83rd out of 127 countries.<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Libya#cite_note-275">[272]</a>
</p>
<h3>Education</h3><p>
Main article: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Education_in_Libya" title="Education in Libya">Education in Libya</a></p>

<p>Libya\'s population includes 1.7 million students, over 270,000 of whom study at the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tertiary_education" title="Tertiary education">tertiary level</a>.<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Libya#cite_note-Libedu-276">[273]</a> Basic education in Libya is free for all citizens,<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Libya#cite_note-277">[274]</a> and is compulsory up to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secondary_education" title="Secondary education">secondary level</a>. The adult literacy rate in 2010 was 89.2%.<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Libya#cite_note-unescolit-278">[275]</a>
</p>

<p>After Libya\'s independence in 1951, its first university, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Libya" title="University of Libya">University of Libya</a>, was established in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benghazi" title="Benghazi">Benghazi</a> by royal decree.<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Libya#cite_note-Libedu2-279">[276]</a> In the 1975–76 academic year the number of university students was estimated to be 13,418. As of 2004<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Libya&amp;action=edit">[update]</a>, this number has increased to more than 200,000, with another 70,000 enrolled in the higher technical and vocational sector.<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Libya#cite_note-Libedu-276">[273]</a> The rapid increase in the number of students in the higher education sector has been mirrored by an increase in the number of institutions of higher education.
</p>

<p>Since 1975 the number of public universities has grown from two to twelve and since their introduction in 1980, the number of higher technical and vocational institutes has grown to 84.[<i>? <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Please_clarify" title="Wikipedia:Please clarify">clarification needed</a></i>]<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Libya#cite_note-Libedu-276">[273]</a> Since 2007 some new private universities such as the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Libyan_International_Medical_University" title="Libyan International Medical University">Libyan International Medical University</a> have been established. Although before 2011 a small number of private institutions were given accreditation, the majority of Libya\'s higher education has always been financed by the public budget. In 1998 the budget allocation for education represented 38.2% of Libya\'s national budget.<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Libya#cite_note-Libedu2-279">[276]</a>
</p>

<p>In 2024, the Ministry of Education announced the launch of the Full-Day School Project in which 12 schools in different parts of the country will have longer school days. The project aims to provide 800 hours of instruction per year to 3,300 elementary school students.<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Libya#cite_note-280">[277]</a>
</p>
<h3>Ethnicity</h3>
<p>The original inhabitants of Libya belonged predominantly to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berber_people" title="Berber people">Berber</a> ethnic groups; however, the long series of foreign invasions and migrations – particularly by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arabs" title="Arabs">Arabs</a> – had a profound and lasting ethnic, linguistic, and cultural influence on Libyan demographics. Centuries of large-scale <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arab_migration_to_the_Maghreb" title="Arab migration to the Maghreb">Arab migration to the Maghreb</a> since the 7th century shifted the demographics of Libya in favour of Arabs. Some <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turkish_people" title="Turkish people">Turks</a> settled in Libya during the rule of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ottoman_Empire" title="Ottoman Empire">Ottoman Empire</a>.
</p>

<p>Most of Libya\'s inhabitants are <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arabs" title="Arabs">Arab</a>,<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Libya#cite_note-:2-25">[22]</a> with many tracing their ancestry to Bedouin Arab tribes like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Banu_Sulaym" title="Banu Sulaym">Banu Sulaym</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Banu_Hilal" title="Banu Hilal">Banu Hilal</a>, plus Turkish and Berber minorities. The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turks_in_Libya" title="Turks in Libya">Turkish minority</a> are often called "<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kouloughlis" title="Kouloughlis">Kouloughlis</a>" and are concentrated in and around villages and towns.<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Libya#cite_note-281">[278]</a> There are some ethnic minorities, such as the Berber <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tuareg_people" title="Tuareg people">Tuareg</a> and the Black African <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toubou_people" title="Toubou people">Tebou</a>.<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Libya#cite_note-Dupree_1958_loc=33-44-282">[279]</a>
</p>

<p>Most <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italian_settlers_in_Libya" title="Italian settlers in Libya">Italian settlers</a>, at their height numbering over half a million, left after Italian Libya\'s independence in 1947. More repatriated in 1970 after the accession of Muammar Gaddafi, but a few hundred returned in the 2000s.<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Libya#cite_note-283">[280]</a>
</p>
<h3>Foreign labour</h3>
<p>As of 2023, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Organization_for_Migration_(IOM)_Mission_in_Ukraine" title="International Organization for Migration (IOM) Mission in Ukraine">International Organization for Migration (IOM)</a> estimates that approximately 10% of Libya\'s population (upwards of 700,000 people) constituted foreign labour.<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Libya#cite_note-284">[281]</a> Prior to the 2011 revolution, official and unofficial figures of migrant labour ranged from 25% to 40% of the population (between 1.5 and 2.4 million people). Historically, Libya hosted millions of low- and high-skilled Egyptian migrants, in particular.<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Libya#cite_note-285">[282]</a>
</p>

<p>It is difficult to estimate the total number of immigrants in Libya because the census figures, official counts and typically more accurate unofficial estimates all differ. In the 2006 census, around 359,540 foreign nationals were resident in Libya out of a population of over 5.5 million (6.35% of the population). Almost half of these were <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Egyptians" title="Egyptians">Egyptians</a>, followed by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demographics_of_Sudan" title="Demographics of Sudan">Sudanese</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palestinians" title="Palestinians">Palestinian</a> immigrants.<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Libya#cite_note-EU_migrant_policy_Centre-286">[283]</a>
During the 2011 revolution, 768,362 immigrants fled Libya as calculated by the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Organization_for_Migration" title="International Organization for Migration">IOM</a>, around 13% of the population at the time, although many more stayed on in the country.<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Libya#cite_note-EU_migrant_policy_Centre-286">[283]</a><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Libya#cite_note-287">[284]</a>
</p>

<p>If consular records prior to the revolution are used to estimate the immigrant population, as many as 2 million Egyptian migrants were recorded by the Egyptian embassy in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tripoli,_Libya" title="Tripoli, Libya">Tripoli</a> in 2009, followed by 87,200 <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tunisians" title="Tunisians">Tunisians</a>, and 68,200 <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moroccans" title="Moroccans">Moroccans</a> by their respective embassies. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turkey" title="Turkey">Turkey</a> recorded the evacuation of 25,000 workers during the 2011 uprising.<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Libya#cite_note-288">[285]</a> The number of Asian migrants before the revolution were just over 100,000 (60,000 Bangladeshis, 20,000 Filipinos, 18,000 Indians, 10,000 Pakistanis, as well as Chinese, Korean, Vietnamese, Thai and other workers).<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Libya#cite_note-289">[286]</a><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Libya#cite_note-290">[287]</a> This would put the immigrant population at almost 40% before the revolution and is a figure more consistent with government estimates in 2004 which put the regular and irregular migrant numbers at 1.35 to 1.8 million (25–33% of the population at the time).<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Libya#cite_note-EU_migrant_policy_Centre-286">[283]</a>
</p>

<p>Libya\'s native population of Arabs-Berbers as well as Arab migrants of various nationalities collectively make up 97% of the population as of 2014<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Libya&amp;action=edit">[update]</a>.

<p>About 97% of the population in Libya are <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muslims" title="Muslims">Muslims</a>, most of whom belong to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunni_Islam" title="Sunni Islam">Sunni branch</a>.<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Libya#cite_note-spooks-263">[260]</a><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Libya#cite_note-Chivvis-2014-294">[291]</a> Small numbers of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ibadi" title="Ibadi">Ibadi</a> Muslims live in the country.<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Libya#cite_note-295">[292]</a><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Libya#cite_note-296">[293]</a>
</p>

<p>Before the 1930s, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Senussi" title="Senussi">Senussi</a> Sunni Sufi movement was the primary Islamic movement in Libya. This was a religious revival adapted to desert life. Its <i>zawaaya</i> (lodges) were found in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tripolitania" title="Tripolitania">Tripolitania</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fezzan" title="Fezzan">Fezzan</a>, but Senussi influence was strongest in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyrenaica" title="Cyrenaica">Cyrenaica</a>. Rescuing the region from unrest and anarchy, the Senussi movement gave the Cyrenaican tribal people a religious attachment and feelings of unity and purpose.<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Libya#cite_note-senussi-297">[294]</a> This Islamic movement was eventually destroyed by the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italo-Turkish_War" title="Italo-Turkish War">Italian invasion</a>. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muammar_Gaddafi" title="Muammar Gaddafi">Gaddafi</a> asserted that he was a devout Muslim, and his government was taking a role in supporting <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islam" title="Islam">Islamic</a> institutions and in worldwide proselytising on behalf of Islam.<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Libya#cite_note-298">[295]</a>
</p>

<p>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Religious_Freedom_Report" title="International Religious Freedom Report">International Religious Freedom Report</a> 2004 noted that "<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bishops" title="Bishops">bishops</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Priests" title="Priests">priests</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuns" title="Nuns">nuns</a> wear religious dress freely in public and report virtually no discrimination," while also "enjoying good relations with the Government". The report also indicated that members of minority religions said "they do not face harassment by authorities or the Muslim majority on the basis of their religious practices". The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Christian_Concern" title="International Christian Concern">International Christian Concern</a> does not list Libya as a country where there is "persecution or severe discrimination against Christians".<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Libya#cite_note-299">[296]</a> Since the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_Libyan_Civil_War" title="First Libyan Civil War">fall of Gaddafi</a>, ultra-conservative strains of Islam have reasserted themselves in places. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Derna,_Libya" title="Derna, Libya">Derna</a> in eastern Libya, historically a hotbed of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jihadist" title="Jihadist">jihad</a> thought, came under the control of militants aligned with the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islamic_State" title="Islamic State">Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant</a> in 2014.<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Libya#cite_note-300">[297]</a> Jihadist elements have also spread to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sirte" title="Sirte">Sirte</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benghazi" title="Benghazi">Benghazi</a>, among other areas, as a result of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_Libyan_Civil_War_(2014%E2%80%93present)" title="Second Libyan Civil War (2014–present)">Second Libyan Civil War</a>.<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Libya#cite_note-301">[298]</a><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Libya#cite_note-302">[299]</a>
</p>

<p>Prior to independence, Libya was home to more than 140,000 <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christian" title="Christian">Christians</a> (mostly of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italian_settlers_in_Libya" title="Italian settlers in Libya">Italian</a> and Maltese ancestry). Many Christian settlers left to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italy" title="Italy">Italy</a> or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malta" title="Malta">Malta</a> after the independence.<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Libya#cite_note-303">[300]</a> Small foreign communities of Christians remained. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coptic_Orthodox_Church" title="Coptic Orthodox Church">Coptic Orthodox Christianity</a>, the predominant Christian church of Egypt, is the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coptic_Orthodox_Church_in_Africa#Libya,_Tunisia,_Algeria_and_Morocco" title="Coptic Orthodox Church in Africa">largest and most historic Christian denomination in Libya</a>. There are about 60,000 Egyptian <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copt" title="Copt">Copts</a> in Libya.<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Libya#cite_note-304">[301]</a> There are three Coptic Churches in Libya, one in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tripoli,_Libya" title="Tripoli, Libya">Tripoli</a>, one in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benghazi" title="Benghazi">Benghazi</a>, and one in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Misurata" title="Misurata">Misurata</a>.
</p>

<p>The Coptic Church has grown in recent years in Libya, due to the growing immigration of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copts_in_Egypt" title="Copts in Egypt">Egyptian Copts</a> to Libya. There are an estimated 40,000 <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_Catholic" title="Roman Catholic">Roman Catholics</a> in Libya who are served by two bishops, one in Tripoli (serving the Italian community) and one in Benghazi (serving the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maltese_people" title="Maltese people">Maltese</a> community). There is also a small <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anglican" title="Anglican">Anglican</a> community, made up mostly of African immigrant workers in Tripoli which is part of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anglican_Diocese_of_Egypt" title="Anglican Diocese of Egypt">Anglican Diocese of Egypt</a>. People have been arrested on suspicion of being <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christian_missionaries" title="Christian missionaries">Christian missionaries</a>, as proselytising is illegal.<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Libya#cite_note-305">[302]</a> Christians have also faced the threat of violence from radical Islamists in some parts of the country, with a well-publicised video released by the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant in February 2015 depicting the mass beheading of Christian Copts.<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Libya#cite_note-306">[303]</a><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Libya#cite_note-307">[304]</a> Libya was ranked fourth on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_Doors" title="Open Doors">Open Doors</a>\' 2022 World Watch List, an annual ranking of the 50 countries where Christians face the most extreme persecution.<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Libya#cite_note-308">[305]</a>
</p>

<p>Libya was once the home of one of the oldest <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jewish_ethnic_divisions" title="Jewish ethnic divisions">Jewish communities</a> in the world, dating back to at least 300 BC.<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Libya#cite_note-309">[306]</a> In 1942, the Italian Fascist authorities set up forced labour camps south of Tripoli for the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jews" title="Jews">Jews</a>, including <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Giado" title="Giado">Giado</a> (about 3,000 Jews), <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gharyan" title="Gharyan">Gharyan</a>, Jeren, and Tigrinna. In Giado, some 500 Jews died of weakness, hunger, and disease. In 1942, Jews who were not in the concentration camps were heavily restricted in their economic activity and all men between 18 and 45 years were drafted for forced labour. In August 1942, Jews from Tripolitania were interned in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sidi_Azaz_labor_camp" title="Sidi Azaz labor camp">a concentration camp at Sidi Azaz</a>. In the three years after November 1945, more than 140 Jews were murdered, and hundreds more wounded, in a series of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pogrom" title="Pogrom">pogroms</a>.<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Libya#cite_note-harris-310">[307]</a> By 1948, about 38,000 Jews remained in the country. Upon Libyan independence in 1951, most of the Jewish community emigrated.

<p>Many Arabic speaking <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demographics_of_Libya" title="Demographics of Libya">Libyans</a> consider themselves as part of a wider <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arab_diaspora" title="Arab diaspora">Arab community</a>. This was strengthened by the spread of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pan-Arabism" title="Pan-Arabism">Pan-Arabism</a> in the mid-20th century, and their reach to power in Libya where they instituted <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arabic_language" title="Arabic language">Arabic</a> as the only official language of the state. Under <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muammar_Gaddafi" title="Muammar Gaddafi">Gaddafi</a>\'s rule, the teaching and even use of indigenous <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berber_language" title="Berber language">Berber language</a> was strictly forbidden.<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Libya#cite_note-311">[308]</a> In addition to banning foreign languages previously taught in academic institutions, leaving entire generations of Libyans with limitations in their comprehension of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/English_language" title="English language">English language</a>. Both the spoken Arabic dialects and Berber, still retain words from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italian_language" title="Italian language">Italian</a>, that were acquired before and during the <i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italian_Libya" title="Italian Libya">Libia Italiana</a></i> period.
</p>

<p>Libyans have a heritage in the traditions of the previously nomadic <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bedouin" title="Bedouin">Bedouin</a> Arabic speakers and sedentary <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berbers" title="Berbers">Berber</a> tribes. Most Libyans associate themselves with a particular family name originating from tribal or conquest based heritage.[<i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed" title="Wikipedia:Citation needed">citation needed</a></i>]

<p>Reflecting the "nature of giving" (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arabic_language" title="Arabic language">Arabic</a>: الاحسان <i><i>Ihsan</i></i>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berber_languages" title="Berber languages">Berber languages</a>: ⴰⵏⴰⴽⴽⴰⴼ Anakkaf ), amongst the Libyan people as well as the sense of hospitality, the state of Libya made it to the top 20 on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charities_Aid_Foundation" title="Charities Aid Foundation">Charities Aid Foundation</a>\'s World Giving Index in 2013.<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Libya#cite_note-312">[309]</a> According to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charities_Aid_Foundation" title="Charities Aid Foundation">Charities Aid Foundation</a> (CAF), in a typical month, almost three-quarters (72%) of all Libyans helped somebody they did not know – the third highest level across all 135 countries surveyed.

<p>There are few theatres or art galleries due to the decades of cultural repression under the Gaddafi regime and lack of infrastructure development under the regime of dictatorship.<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Libya#cite_note-313">[310]</a> For many years there have been no public theatres, and only very few cinemas showing foreign films. The tradition of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Folklore" title="Folklore">folk culture</a> is still alive and well, with troupes performing music and dance at frequent festivals, both in Libya and abroad.<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Libya#cite_note-314">[311]</a>
</p>

<p>A large number of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Television_in_Libya" title="Television in Libya">Libyan television</a> stations are devoted to political review, Islamic topics and cultural phenomena. A number of TV stations air various styles of traditional Libyan music.[<i>? <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Please_clarify" title="Wikipedia:Please clarify">clarification needed</a></i>] <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tuareg_music" title="Tuareg music">Tuareg music</a> and dance are popular in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ghadames" title="Ghadames">Ghadames</a> and the south.

<p>Many Libyans frequent the country\'s beach and they also visit Libya\'s archaeological sites—especially <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leptis_Magna" title="Leptis Magna">Leptis Magna</a>, which is widely considered to be one of the best preserved Roman archaeological sites in the world.<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Libya#cite_note-316">[313]</a> The most common form of public transport between cities is the bus, though many people travel by automobile. There are no railway services in Libya, but these are planned for construction in the near future (see <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rail_transport_in_Libya" title="Rail transport in Libya">rail transport in Libya</a>).<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Libya#cite_note-317">[314]</a>

<p>Libya\'s capital, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tripoli,_Libya" title="Tripoli, Libya">Tripoli</a>, has many museums and archives.

<h3>Cuisine</h3><p>
Main article: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Libyan_cuisine" title="Libyan cuisine">Libyan cuisine</a></p>

<p>Libyan cuisine is a mixture of the different <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italian_cuisine" title="Italian cuisine">Italian</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arab_cuisine#Bedouin_cuisine" title="Arab cuisine">Bedouin</a> and traditional <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arab_cuisine" title="Arab cuisine">Arab</a> culinary influences.<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Libya#cite_note-319">[316]</a> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pasta" title="Pasta">Pasta</a> is the staple food in the Western side of Libya, whereas <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rice" title="Rice">rice</a> is generally the staple food in the east.[<i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed" title="Wikipedia:Citation needed">citation needed</a></i>]
</p>

<p>Common Libyan foods include several variations of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tomato_sauce" title="Tomato sauce">red tomato sauce</a> based pasta dishes (similar to the Italian <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arrabbiata_sauce" title="Arrabbiata sauce">Sugo all\'arrabbiata</a> dish), rice, usually served with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lamb_and_mutton" title="Lamb and mutton">lamb</a> or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicken_as_food" title="Chicken as food">chicken</a> (typically stewed, fried, grilled, or boiled in-sauce), and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Couscous" title="Couscous">couscous</a>, which is steam cooked whilst held over boiling red tomato sauce and meat (sometimes also containing <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zucchini" title="Zucchini">zucchini</a>/courgettes and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chickpea" title="Chickpea">chickpeas</a>), and typically served along with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cucumber" title="Cucumber">cucumber</a> slices, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lettuce" title="Lettuce">lettuce</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olive" title="Olive">olives</a>.[<i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed" title="Wikipedia:Citation needed">citation needed</a></i>]
</p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bazeen" title="Bazeen">Bazeen</a>, a dish made from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barley_flour" title="Barley flour">barley flour</a> and served with red tomato sauce, is customarily eaten communally, with several people sharing the same dish, usually by hand.

<p>A very common snack eaten by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demographics_of_Libya" title="Demographics of Libya">Libyans</a> is known as <i>khubs bi\' tun</i>, literally meaning "bread with tuna fish", usually served as a baked <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baguette" title="Baguette">baguette</a> or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pita" title="Pita">pita bread</a> stuffed with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_tuna_dishes" title="List of tuna dishes">tuna fish</a> that has been mixed with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harissa" title="Harissa">harissa</a> (chili sauce) and olive oil. Many snack vendors prepare these <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sandwich" title="Sandwich">sandwiches</a> and they can be found all over Libya. Libyan restaurants may serve international cuisine, or may serve simpler fare such as lamb, chicken, vegetable stew, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Potato" title="Potato">potatoes</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macaroni" title="Macaroni">macaroni</a>.[<i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed" title="Wikipedia:Citation needed">citation needed</a></i>] Due to severe lack of infrastructure, many under-developed areas and small towns do not have restaurants and instead food stores may be the only source to obtain food products. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alcoholic_beverage" title="Alcoholic beverage">Alcohol</a> consumption is illegal.<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Libya#cite_note-321">[318]</a>

After eating, Libyans often drink <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_tea" title="Black tea">black tea</a>. This is normally repeated a second time (for the second glass of tea), and in the third round of tea, it is served with roasted <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peanut" title="Peanut">peanuts</a> or roasted <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Almond" title="Almond">almonds</a> known as <i>shay bi\'l-luz</i> (mixed with the tea in the same glass).<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Libya#cite_note-Libyan_Food-322">[319]</a>
